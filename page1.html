      <h2>SciQuel Web Development Internship</h2>
      <div class="textual-description">
        <p>This internship was my first real experience with web development. My first main project was to design one of
          the web pages for the website, which is how I became acquainted with HTML and CSS. I worked with 30
          individuals from many different universities across the world. Communication and Teamwork skills were tested
          much more greatly due to the huge time zone differences, and I learned how to maintain constant communication
          via Slack or even impromptu Zoom calls.</p>
        <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Experience Image" class="inline-image">
        <p>I enhanced and developed the interface of SciQuel's app with React, facilitating the dissemination of
          scientific articles. I also pitched and developed UI design ideas in biweekly meetings.</p>
        <img src="image4.jpg" alt="Experience Image" class="inline-image">
        <p>This experience taught me the importance of effective communication and teamwork, especially in a remote
          working environment.</p>
