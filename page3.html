      <h2>Legion Technologies Internship</h2>
      <div class="textual-description">
        <p>This was my first experience working in a tech company, especially in a startup setting. Although my previous
          experiences, I worked with many peers the same age and experience level as me, this was the first time I got
          to work with professionals many years my senior. I was first assigned small tasks to become more familiar with
          the company's codebase and log handling structure. I identified top 10 exceptions weekly in system error logs
          through LogQL queries in UAT, RC, and EA
          environments. Next, I moved on to working with other members on the product team. I debugged and resolved top
          exceptions in Java with them. I also created custom filters with Java and integrated
          them to the log4j2 logging framework to make logs more legible for these developers. Finally, I was tasked
          with finding an alternative error handling and logging system to their current one that they used. I
          researched and implemented
          Rollbar for error tracking to replace current error tracking conducted in Grafana Loki.
