      <h2>Legion Technologies Internship</h2>
      <div class="textual-description">
        <p>This was my first experience working in a tech company, especially in a startup setting with senior
          professionals. Legion Technologies is a company that specializes in workforce labor optimization. It's main
          product is building an app that allows hourly workers to optimize the hours of their shifts and makes it much
          easier for them to schedule their shifts.
          environments. </p>

        <p>My main job was working with their error logs. I went through all the system error logs in Grafana Loki and
          wrote many queries to identify their top 10 exceptions. Below in an image of an example query I wrote in
          Grafana Loki and the chart generated.</p>

        <p> Finally, I was tasked
          with finding an alternative error handling and logging system to their current one that they used. I
          researched and implemented
          Rollbar for error tracking to replace current error tracking conducted in Grafana Loki. I found out that this
          system was a much better alternative than their current one for it was much faster and much more
          cost-effective. Below is an example of Rollbar logging the most common errors found in system logs. </p>
