      <div class="textual-description">
        <p>In Cornell Nexus, I learned the importance of teamwork and leadership. I was the software subteam leader for
          a year, and learned how to communicate and enforce tasks to my team members. I would also review and debug
          majority of code merged into main codebase through Github Pull Request Reviews. It was the first time I got to
          work in such a highly motivated, team setting where we were all passionately working towards a self-imposed
          goal. </p>

        <p>Our overall goal is to get the robot to traverse a beach and pick up microplastics. Our current progress so
          far is we are able to get the robot to move in a straight line based on the code that software has written.

        <p>I’ve implemented the robot’s docking algorithm to return to its base charging station after it is done
          traversing the beach using computer vision and April Tags (QR-like codes). Below is an image of an object
          detection and recognition algorithm our robot as it attempts to
          dock back home.</p>
